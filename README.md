## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run This Project

You can run this project in **two ways**:

---

### Method 1: Using Docker Image (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have **PostgreSQL running** on your machine or a remote server.  
2. Create a database and user matching the environment variables (e.g. `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`).  
3. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:  
   ```bash
   docker pull yourdockerhubusername/clinic_reservation_system:latest


4. Run the container (replace environment variables accordingly):

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm -it clinic_reservation_system
   ```
5. When prompted, enter the environment configuration values (or accept defaults).
6. The system will apply migrations, create a superuser, collect static files, and start the Django server automatically.

   python manage.py makemigrations core lazer_area payment reserve
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Create a superuser (you will be prompted to set username and password):

   ```
6. Collect static files:

   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
